This is the initial development of the web application to be hosted on projectweb.
It uses flask. Flask requires an environmental variable to load its test server that runs on localhost, so source ~/environ for flask.
The pipenv has all the requisites to run this. All you need to do is:
pipenv shell

This loads the virtual environment.
Different extensions are available depending on your shell, but you'll likely want the default without one if you're using sh, bash, or zsh.

Requirements:
	flask
  flask-ldap-login
	html boilerplate - https://html5boilerplate.com/ - https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate
